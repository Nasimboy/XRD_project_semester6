\section{Sources of X-rays}

	For X-ray diffraction experiments, monochromatic radiation from various metal-based sources (eg. Cu, Ag, Mo) is used in the lab. There are also synchotron-based sources for X-rays.%

	    	    \item \ul{Fine focus sources}: Operate at around $50~\si{kV}$ and $40~\si{mA}$ ($\sim \SI{2}{kW}$). Can give a photon flux of around $\SI{1e7}{photons/s~mm^2}.$
	    	    
	    	    \item \ul{Microfocus sources}: Highly focussed beam. Operates at $40-50~\si{kV}$ and $2-15~\si{mA}$  ($<\SI{1}{kW}$). Can provide around $\SI{1e8}{photons/s~mm^2}.$
	    	    
	    	\end{itemize}
	    	
	    \item \bfnt{Rotating anode based source}: The anode is rotated at a very high speed of around $10,000~\si{rpm}.$ Cu, Mo or dual anode is used. Generally microfocus-based system. Operates at $\SI{60}{kV}$ and $\SI{100}{mA}$ or higher ($> \SI{6}{kW}$). Can produce a flux $\sim \num{1e10}-\num{e11}~\si{photons/s~mm^2}.$
	    
	    \item \bfnt{Metal Jet source}: Liquid Gallium is used, giving $\lambda = \SI{1.340}{\angstrom}.$ High intensity at much low power. Can generate $\sim \num{1e11}-\num{e12}~\si{photons/s~mm^2}.$
